if closed, navigate to this folder and run:

vagrant ssh
sys161          is the password

cd ~/src/os161/kern/conf
./config ASST1           when downloading new source tree or add files by editting kern/conf/conf.kern
cd ../compile/ASST1
bmake depend             makes sure headers included    if reconfigured kernel?

                         generally need to redo these 2.
bmake                    generates kernel binary
bmake install            installs kernel into root directory defined in config.








after changing os, navigate to ~/os161/root and run
sys161 kernel
 

find ./ -name fileName
grep -rnwi -e 'stringtofind'
grep -r 'stringtofind' ~/
